Sound Storage was created to handle sound files. All sounds can be shazamed or something like that. We don't take it sounds as our. Every sound is public-access so everyone can download it.

Also all programs here are without viruses and we don't take care if something will happen. You can use other programs to decompile apps to make sure they're not doing anything dangerous. You can check out source repository of all our other sub applications. (Link: Not published yet)
